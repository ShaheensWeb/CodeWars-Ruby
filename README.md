# CodeWars-Ruby
Hello and Welcome! 
My names Shaheen Ghazazani, www.shaiwanghazazani.com (blog), and I am a Carleton University second year computer science student. 

I will be using three main repos over at (github.com/shaheensweb);


  #1: CodeWars-Ruby -> You are currently here
  
  
  #2: CodeWars-Python 
  
  
  #3: CodeWars-JavaScript

Phase #1:


Using these three repos I will do one to n amounts of www.codewars.com katas as a training regiment to make sure I 
am constantly getting better and better at these three core langauges. 

Phase #2: 


Once I have completed enough of these three sections I will transform them into the following;


  #1: CodeWars-Ruby will become a dedication to Rails extention of ruby


  #2: CodeWars-Python will remain the same, daily python problems!


  #3: CodeWars-JavaScript will transfer more to the creative game dev aspect or web dev applications


  as it currently sits inline with what I intend to work on in the future.

  #1: Email: seanghazazani@cmail.carleton.ca


  #2: Personal Email: shaheenghazazani@gmail.com  (Use either or, makes no difference)

  #3: Skype: Shaheeng1

Feel free to email me calling me a lazy if I dont push a minimum of 1 contribution to each of these repos everyday.
